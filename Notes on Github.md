## Some Wisdom:
* (You can make commits to the master branch and simultaneously make it into a different branch and submit a pull request.)
* (Forking, or copying a repository, is basically only applicable in groups or things you don't want to mess up.)
* (Deleting repositories is in the settings. Deleting pull requests and branches is under pull requests.)
